# Interest Rate Management Feature

## ✅ What Was Missing

The company dashboard was missing the ability to **edit and update interest rates** after registration. Companies could set rates during registration but had no way to change them later.

---

## 🎯 Solution Implemented

Added a complete **Interest Rate Settings** dialog that allows companies to update their rates at any time.

---

## 🆕 New Features

### 1. Settings Button
**Location:** Company Dashboard header, next to interest rates display

**Features:**
- Small "Edit Rates" button with Settings icon

- Opens settings dialog on click

**Visual:**

```

---

### 2. Interest Rate Settings Dialog

**Components:**

#### Current Rates Display
- Shows existing rates in a highlighted box
- 3 columns: 3 months, 6 months, 12 months
- Easy comparison with new rates

#### Rate Input Fields

- Helper text for each field

#### Action Buttons
