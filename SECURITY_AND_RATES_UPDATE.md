# Security & Flexible Interest Rates Update

## 🔒 Security Enhancement - Route Protection

### Problem Fixed:
Employees could access company dashboard pages by typing the URL directly, even though they shouldn't have access.

### Solution Implemented:
**Enhanced ProtectedRoute Component** with user type verification.

#### How It Works:

1. **User Type Checking**:
   - When accessing a protected route, the system checks which Firestore collection the user belongs to
   - Company routes check the `companies` collection
   - Employee routes check the `employees` collection

2. **Automatic Redirection**:
   - If an employee tries to access `/company/dashboard`, they're redirected to `/employee/dashboard`
   - If a company user tries to access `/employee/dashboard`, they're redirected to `/company/dashboard`
   - Unauthenticated users are redirected to the appropriate login page

3. **Implementation**:
   ```typescript
   // Company Dashboard - Only accessible by companies
   <ProtectedRoute redirectTo="/company/login" userType="company">
     <CompanyDashboard />
   </ProtectedRoute>
   
   // Employee Dashboard - Only accessible by employees
   <ProtectedRoute redirectTo="/employee/login" userType="employee">
     <EmployeeDashboard />
   </ProtectedRoute>
   ```

#### Security Benefits:
- ✅ Prevents unauthorized cross-access
- ✅ Validates user type against Firestore data
- ✅ Automatic redirection to correct dashboard
- ✅ No way to bypass via URL manipulation

## 💰 Flexible Interest Rates by Term

### Problem Fixed:
Companies could only set one interest rate for all loan terms. They wanted different rates for different durations (e.g., 5% for 3 months, 10% for 12 months).

### Solution Implemented:
**Term-Specific Interest Rates** with flexible configuration.

#### New Interest Rate Structure:

```typescript
interface InterestRatesByTerm {
  "3": number;   // 3 months rate
  "6": number;   // 6 months rate
  "12": number;  // 12 months rate
}
```

#### Company Side:

**Registration:**
- Set three different interest rates during registration
- Default values: 5% (3mo), 7% (6mo), 10% (12mo)
- Each rate can be 0-50%

**Dashboard Display:**
- Shows all three rates in header: "Rates: 3mo-5% | 6mo-7% | 12mo-10%"
- Clear visibility of current rate structure

**Example:**
```
Company Registration:
- 3 Months: 5%
- 6 Months: 7%
- 12 Months: 10%

Dashboard Header:
"Balance: $50,000 • Rates: 3mo-5% | 6mo-7% | 12mo-10%"
```

#### Employee Side:

**Loan Request Form:**
- Dropdown shows term with corresponding rate
- Options display as: "3 months - 5% interest"
- Current rate shown below: "Interest rate: 5% (set by company)"
- Rate updates automatically when term changes

**Real-Time Calculation:**
- Loan summary uses the correct rate for selected term
- Employees see exact costs before submitting

**Example:**
```
Repayment Term Dropdown:
☐ 3 months - 5% interest
☑ 6 months - 7% interest
☐ 12 months - 10% interest

Below dropdown:
"Interest rate: 7% (set by company)"

Loan Summary:
Principal: $5,000
Interest (7%): $175.00
Total: $5,175.00
Monthly: $862.50
```
