# CRA Conversion Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to convert the Vite-based React project to a Create React App (CRA) project.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated package.json
- Changed project name from `vite_react_shadcn_ts` to `cra_react_shadcn_ts`
- Updated version from `0.0.0` to `0.1.0`
- Removed Vite-specific dependencies:
  - `@vitejs/plugin-react-swc`
  - `vite`
  - `lovable-tagger`
- Added CRA dependencies:
  - `react-scripts` version `5.0.1`
  - `web-vitals` version `^2.1.4`
- Updated scripts:
  - `start`: `react-scripts start`
  - `build`: `react-scripts build`
  - `test`: `react-scripts test`
  - `eject`: `react-scripts eject`
- Added CRA-specific configuration:
  - `eslintConfig` with `react-app` and `react-app/jest` extends
  - `browserslist` configuration

### 2. Removed Vite-specific files
- Deleted `vite.config.ts`
- Deleted `tsconfig.node.json`
- Deleted `tsconfig.app.json`

### 3. Created CRA-specific files
- Created `public/manifest.json` with PWA configuration
- Created placeholder files for `public/logo192.png` and `public/logo512.png`
- Updated `public/index.html` to match CRA template

### 4. Updated configuration files
- Renamed `src/main.tsx` to `src/index.tsx`
- Updated `tsconfig.json` to match CRA TypeScript configuration

### 5. Installed dependencies
- Installed `react-scripts` with `--legacy-peer-deps` flag
- Attempted to resolve dependency conflicts with `ajv` and `ajv-keywords`

## Issues Encountered

During the conversion process, we encountered dependency conflicts, particularly with:
- TypeScript version compatibility
- AJV (Another JSON Schema Validator) version conflicts
- Various deprecated packages showing warnings

## Next Steps

To fully complete the conversion, you may need to:
1. Resolve remaining dependency conflicts
2. Test the application thoroughly
3. Update any Vite-specific code that may not be compatible with CRA
4. Verify that all shadcn-ui components work correctly with CRA

## Running the Application

Once dependencies are resolved, you should be able to run:
```bash
npm start
```

To build for production:
```bash
npm run build
```
