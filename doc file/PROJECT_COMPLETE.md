## 🔑 Key Implementation Details

### Company Dashboard (`CompanyDashboard.tsx`)
- **Real-time data loading**: Fetches employees and loans from Firestore
- **Employee names in loans**: Joins employee data with loan data
- **Approve/Reject actions**: Updates loan status in Firestore
- **Statistics**: Calculates pending, approved, rejected counts
- **Authentication**: Redirects to login if not authenticated
- **Logout**: Signs out and redirects to login page

### Employee Dashboard (`EmployeeDashboard.tsx`)
- **Loan validation**: Prevents requesting more than salary
- **Real-time updates**: Reloads loans after submission
- **Status badges**: Color-coded (pending=gray, approved=green, rejected=red)
- **Authentication**: Redirects to login if not authenticated

### Protected Routes (`ProtectedRoute.tsx`)
- **Auth state monitoring**: Uses Firebase `onAuthStateChanged`
- **Loading state**: Shows loading screen while checking auth
- **Redirect logic**: Sends unauthenticated users to login

### Firebase Configuration (`firebase.ts`)
- **Environment variables**: Secure credential management
- **Analytics**: Firebase Analytics initialized
- **Exports**: Auth, Firestore, and Analytics instances
