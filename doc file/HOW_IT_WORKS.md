## 🔐 Authentication & Security

### **Firebase Authentication**
- **Email/Password** authentication
- **Protected Routes** - Users redirected to login if not authenticated
- **Role-based Access** - Different permissions based on user role
- **Session Management** - Automatic login persistence

### **Security Rules**
```javascript
// Firestore Security Rules
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Companies can only access their own data
    match /companies/{companyId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == companyId;
    }
    
    // Employees can read all, write only their own
    match /employees/{employeeId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == employeeId;
    }
    
    // Loans accessible by authenticated users
    match /loans/{loanId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow create: if request.auth != null;
      allow update: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

### **Permission System**
```typescript
// Role-based permissions
const getPermissions = (role: UserRole) => {
  switch (role) {
    case "admin":
      return {
        canApproveLoan: true,
        canRejectLoan: true,
        canViewAllEmployees: true,
        canEditEmployees: true,
        canViewFinancials: true,
        canManageRoles: true,
      };
    case "manager":
      return {
        canApproveLoan: true,
        canRejectLoan: true,
        canViewAllEmployees: true,
        canEditEmployees: false,
        canViewFinancials: true,
        canManageRoles: false,
      };
    case "hr":
      return {
        canApproveLoan: false,
        canRejectLoan: false,
        canViewAllEmployees: true,
        canEditEmployees: true,
        canViewFinancials: false,
        canManageRoles: false,
      };
    default:
      return { /* No permissions */ };
  }
};
```

## 💰 Loan Calculation System

### **Interest Calculation Formula**
```typescript
const calculateLoanDetails = (amount: number, interestRate: number, repaymentTerm: number) => {
  // Monthly interest calculation
  const totalInterest = (amount * interestRate * repaymentTerm) / 1200;
  const totalAmount = amount + totalInterest;
  const monthlyPayment = totalAmount / repaymentTerm;

  return {
    totalInterest,
    totalAmount,
    monthlyPayment,
  };
};
```

### **Example Calculation**
```
Loan Amount: $3,000
Interest Rate: 8% per annum
Repayment Term: 6 months

Calculation:
- Total Interest = (3000 × 8 × 6) / 1200 = $120
- Total Amount = $3,000 + $120 = $3,120
- Monthly Payment = $3,120 / 6 = $520
```
