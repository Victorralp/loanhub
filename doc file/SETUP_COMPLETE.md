# Setup Complete âœ…

## Firebase Configuration

Your Firebase credentials have been successfully configured using environment variables for security.

### What was done:

1. **Created `.env` file** with your Firebase credentials:
   - API Key
   - Auth Domain
   - Project ID
   - Storage Bucket
   - Messaging Sender ID
   - App ID
   - Measurement ID

2. **Updated `firebase.ts`** to use environment variables instead of hardcoded values

3. **Added Firebase Analytics** support

4. **Created `.env.example`** as a template for other developers

5. **Updated `.gitignore`** to prevent committing sensitive credentials

6. **Updated documentation** (README.md and FIREBASE_SETUP.md)

### Your Firebase Project Details:
- **Project ID**: loan-manage-c2f66
- **Auth Domain**: loan-manage-c2f66.firebaseapp.com
- **Analytics**: Enabled

### Next Steps:

1. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. **Test the application:**
   - Register a company account
   - Register an employee account
   - Test loan request and approval flow

3. **Set up Firestore Security Rules** (see FIREBASE_SETUP.md section 6)

### Security Notes:

âœ… Environment variables are properly configured
âœ… `.env` file is in `.gitignore`
âœ… Credentials won't be committed to version control
âœ… Analytics only initializes in browser environment

### Important:

- **Never commit the `.env` file** to version control
- **Share `.env.example`** with other developers
- **Each developer must create their own `.env`** file
- **Restart the dev server** after changing `.env` values

## Ready to Go! ðŸš€

Your loan management system is now properly configured and ready for development.
