# Latest Updates - Interest Rate & Header Enhancement

## 🎯 Changes Made

### 1. ✅ Interest Rate Management (Company-Side)

**Problem:** Employees could set their own interest rates, which doesn't make business sense.

**Solution:** Interest rates are now controlled by the company.

#### Company Side:
- **Registration**: Companies set a default interest rate during registration (default: 5%)
- **Dashboard**: Interest rate is displayed in the company header next to balance
- **Control**: Only companies can set/modify the interest rate

#### Employee Side:
- **Display Only**: Employees see the company's interest rate (read-only)
- **No Input**: Can't modify the rate - it's fixed by their company
- **Clear Label**: Shows "Interest Rate (Set by Company)" with explanation
- **Calculation**: Loan calculations use the company's rate automatically

#### Technical Changes:
- Added `defaultInterestRate` field to Company interface
- Updated CompanyRegister to include interest rate field
- Modified EmployeeDashboard to fetch company's rate from Firestore
- Changed interest rate display from input to read-only badge

### 2. ✅ Enhanced Header Design

**Problem:** Header was too plain and basic.

**Solution:** Modern, professional header with gradients and icons.

#### New Features:
- **Gradient Background**: Subtle gradient from primary color
- **Logo with Icon**: Sparkles icon next to title
- **Gradient Text**: Title uses gradient text effect
- **Icons on Buttons**: Building icon for Company, User icon for Employee
- **Hover Effects**: Scale animation on logo, background change on buttons
- **Better Spacing**: Improved padding and gaps
- **Backdrop Blur**: Modern blur effect for depth

#### Visual Improvements:
- More professional appearance
- Better brand identity
- Improved user experience
- Modern design trends
